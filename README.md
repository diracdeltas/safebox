## Overview

A simple [Meteor](https://meteor.com) + [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io) app for sharing client-side encrypted files. Requires a browser with a working implementation of the AES-GCM webcrypto API. Stable releases of Chrome/Firefox should work, though note that Chrome restricts WebCrypto access to [secure origins](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features).

### !! Warning !!

Do not use this for anything that requires better-than-plaintext securty, given that the code is pretty much untested and unreviewed.

### Demo

Here is a [demo instance](https://alpha.sandstorm.io/grain/hk4cb7b6TDo3st3RMroKAF). If you want a bunny, the password is `iloveoctocats`.

## Building

To run locally without Sandstorm:

    $ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
    $ meteor run

To run with Sandstorm, follow the instructions at https://github.com/sandstorm-io/meteor-spk to download Sandstorm and meteor-spk. Run `meteor-spk build path/to/package.spk` to build the Sandstorm package. Then load the package into a Sandstorm instance after logging in - you can either [set up](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm#installing-the-easy-way) a local instance or just use https://alpha.sandstorm.io.

*Caveat: Local instances that are running without HTTPS at an aliased URL like local.sandstorm.io will not work in Chrome since WebCrypto access is considered a sensitive feature.*
